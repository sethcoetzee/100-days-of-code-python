# 100 Days of Code - Python

Welcome to my **100 days of code - python** journey. This is a learning repository, which contains all the code I am writing during the 100 days of code challenge. I will be updating this repository daily with the code I write.

Please note, **most** the code and project ideas have come from the Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).
