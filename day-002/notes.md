# Day 2 - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

## Learnings

- Primitive data types
    - String - A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, used to represent text.
    - Integer - Whole numbers without a fractional part, used for counting or indexing.
    - Float - Numbers with a decimal point, used for precise calculations.
    - Boolean - Represents `True` or `False`, used for conditional logic.
- Determining the length of a string using `len`.
- Checking data type using `type`.
- Converting between types using `int`, `float`, `str`.
- Mathematic operators
    - Addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`)
    - Multiplication (`*`) and division (`/`)
    - Divison, ignoring the remainder (`//`)
    - Exponent (`**`)
    - Rounding via `round` 
- Order of operations = PEMDAS: parenthesis, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtract. Otherwise, left to right. 
- Assignment operators
    - `+=` - adds and assigns the result to the variable.
    - `-=` - subtracts and assigns the result to the variable.
    - `*=` - multiplies and assigns the result to the variable.
    - `/=` - divides and assigns the result to the variable.
- f-strings - insert a variable into a string - `print(f"{var}")`

## Project

Create a tip calculator using `input`, based on the size of the bill, tip percentage, and number of people to split with.
