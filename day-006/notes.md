# Day 6 - Python Functions and Karel

Goals: Functions; Code blocks; and While loops.

## Learnings

- Functions - bundles of code
    - Defining a new function via `def <function-name>:` and calling it via `<function-name>`.
    - Importance of mindful indentation - tabs vs. spaces.

- `while` loops - contine so long as the specified condition is true. 
    - `for` loop:
        - for item in list_of_items:
            do this
        - for item in range():
            do this

    - `while` loops:
        - while something_is_true:
            do this
            then do this
            then do this

    - Choose a `for` loop when you need to iterate over a list of things.
    - Choose a `while` loop when you don't care where in a list you are, but you do want to continue executing something repeatedly whilst a condition is true. 

    - Booleans - Needs to be written **exactly** as "True" or "False".
